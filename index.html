Welcome to the fast life - enter, if you dare!

<strong>Overview</strong>
Our game is a car racing game where the objective is to get to the checkpoint within the time limit while avoiding obstacles. The score is calculated based on how far you get and how quickly you can get there. The farther you get in the track, the more obstacles there will be. As the game goes on, you can get power ups so that you can accelerate more or hit obstacles without dying. 

<strong>Features</strong>
The game gives the player the option to choose from 3 cars which vary in speed range and acceleration abilities.
