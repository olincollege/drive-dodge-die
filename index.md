Welcome to the fast life - enter, if you dare!

## Overview

Your mission? Reach the checkpoint before time runs out, while skillfully dodging obstacles along the way.
Your score depends on both distance and speed: the farther you progress, the tougher the challenge becomes, with an increasing number of hazards cluttering the track. Fortunately, power-ups are scattered throughout the race, giving you an edge by boosting acceleration or granting temporary immunity against collisions.
It’s a test of reflexes, strategy, and endurance — can you navigate the chaos and make it to the finish line?

## Features

You can choose from 3 cars which vary in speed range and acceleration abilities.

!["car_selection"](media/images/website/car_selection.png)

You'll **drive** your chosen car on a track, **dodge** dangerous obstacles - holes and barriers, or crash on them and **die**!

!["game_running"](media/images/website/game_running.png)

Your car's current speed and gas storage is shown on the right. Acceleration will consume gas, and once you run out of it, you can no longer speed up. When you're not accelerating, the gas will automatically refill.  
The minimap at the top shows length of the road till the next checkpoint and the car's current position.

!["power_up"](media/images/website/power_up.png)

Once you hit the checkpoint, you can choose from two power-ups that make your car stronger. There're five in total - play the game and explore it yourself!
You will also get extra time automatically at checkpoints. However, the distance between checkpoints get longer and longer as the game goes, so drive fast!
