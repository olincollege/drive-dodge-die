Welcome to the fast life - enter, if you dare!

## Overview
Your mission? Reach the checkpoint before time runs out, while skillfully dodging obstacles along the way.
Your score depends on both distance and speed: the farther you progress, the tougher the challenge becomes, with an increasing number of hazards cluttering the track. Fortunately, power-ups are scattered throughout the race, giving you an edge by boosting acceleration or granting temporary immunity against collisions.
It’s a test of reflexes, strategy, and endurance — can you navigate the chaos and make it to the finish line?
